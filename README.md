<h1>Hello, and welcome to my profile! </h1>
<hr/>

I'm RafaÅ‚ ZajÄ…c, and I recently graduated as a Full-Stack developer from code Academy. 

ðŸ’¬ I speak Polish, English and my German is currently around B1 level. 

ðŸ”­ Currently I'm working on improving my portfolio projects with a strong emphasis on testing
(unit and end-to-end) and styling. Most of my time I'm working on my MarsRover project.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m dedicated to build more solid foundations for my skills, so currently I'm focusing a bit more
on vanilla JS, CSS and Sass.

âš¡ Fun fact: I used to think CSS is the most boring tool and tended to overuse styling libraries like bootstrap, 
and focus entirely on building page logic with JS or React. Now I think that as much as it got me some momentum 
at the beginning it was not a way to go. Therefore I'm spending now a lot of time and effort on refactoring my 
projects in this regard.
