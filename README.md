<h1>Hello, and welcome to my profile! </h1>

I'm Rafał Zając, and I recently graduated as a Full-Stack developer from code Academy. 

💬 I speak Polish, English and my German is currently around B2 level. 

🔭 I'm working on improving my portfolio projects on a daily basis. 

🌱 I’m dedicated to build more solid foundations for my skills, currently I'm focusing on PostgreSQL

⚡ Fun fact: While learning, I began to love and appreciate everything I was initially skeptical about. The amount of negative thoughts I had around the new tools I was using seems to be a surprisingly good predictor of their future utility...

📫 If you would like to contact me, just send me an email : rf.zajac@gmail.com
