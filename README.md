<h1>Hello, and welcome to my profile! </h1>

I'm RafaÅ‚ ZajÄ…c, and I recently graduated as a Full-Stack developer from code Academy. 

ðŸ’¬ I speak Polish, English and my German is currently around B2 level. 

ðŸ”­ I'm working on improving my portfolio projects on a daily basis. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m dedicated to build more solid foundations for my skills, currently I'm focusing on PostgreSQL

âš¡ Fun fact: While learning I started to love and appreciate everything I was skeptical about in the first place. Amount of negative thougts around new tools I'm using seem to be a good a pretty decent predictor for future use... 

ðŸ“« If you would like to contact me, just send me an email : rf.zajac@tutamail.com
